In this task I had to add three new clubs, a few members and events for each club using the graphQL interface. 

Steps I undertook to do these things. 

Firstly, I had to bypass authentication. Apart from editing the docker compass and dockerfiles, I also had to change the mutations file for each service and used a dummy user. I had done this to the events, clubs and members services. 

I had made a club and gave my friends email for the clubsid, misinterpreting what it is. 

I also had to disable POC checking for some reason. 

I used the graphQL interface to pass the queries to adding clubs, members and events. I had to learn parts of the graphQL syntax to be able to do that

The JSON files in this folder are exported from mongo-db compass and show the clubs, events and members that I have added

I have also attached screenshots.
