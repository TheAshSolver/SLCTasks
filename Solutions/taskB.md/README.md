In this task, I had to integrate a wordpress frontend with the backend and the services presented here. 

To do that, I had to simply add a wordpress image to the docker compose file and then update the wp-content files with the pages I wanted.

My wordpress front end, visible at port 8080, has two pages, clubs and events.

The clubs page displays the three clubs required and the events page displays the events about to be hosted.

This was achieved through the use of php shortcodes in the wordpress website. 

I apologize for not making the site look better
