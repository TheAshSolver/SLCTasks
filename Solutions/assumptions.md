I have made a few assumptions in each task

Firstly, I have assumed that using a dummy user with the role of the cc is enough to sufficient to bypass authentication. My code works fine, and I am able to see the required fields in the mongodb compass that all changes are updated

Along with removing smaller dependencies, I have also updated the mutations file. 


For the wordpress site, I have used a shortcode to show the list of events and clubs. It shows the list of clubs added through graphQL in the first task. I have used a graphQL AI query for this
